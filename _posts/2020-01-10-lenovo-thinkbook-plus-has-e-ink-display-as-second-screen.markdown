Lenovo has come up with the idea and designed laptop with second screen on top of lid. The screen is non other than E Ink display. E Ink display is called Electronic Ink which is laminated to a plastic screen and sticked to electronics, creating Electronic Paper Display (EPD). 

E Ink display are used in many devices like: Kindle Paperwhite, Dasung Not E-Reader, Sony Digital Paper, etc. All these devices are used for different purposes and has the E Ink screen that is easy to use in sunlights due to its display like Electronic Paper. E Ink screen is good for reading ebooks, writing and many more.

<a href="https://www.lenovo.com/ww/en/solutions/smb/thinkbook-plus" target="_blank">Lenovo Thinkbook Plus</a> has 10.8 inch E Ink display attached to the outside lid of laptop. This display is favourable and is mostly used when the computer is closed. When opened the display hides the crucial data so that people who are sitting in front of you can't see it.The display adds extra help to the people between meetings for convenience. The second screen of E Ink display has features like calendar, events, weather and many more. Taking notes and syncing to Microsoft OneNote is now easier in Thinkbook Plus. The refresh rate of the E Ink display in Thinkbook Plus is surprisingly better. 

### Price and Availability

<a href="https://www.lenovo.com/ww/en/solutions/smb/thinkbook-plus" target="_blank">Thinkbook Plus</a> will be out in March 2020 with the starting price of $1,199. The spec includes Intel 10th Gen Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB M.2 PCIe SSD with 16GB of Intel Optane Memory H10 (Solid State Storage) and Intel UHD Graphics. The RAM and storage can be doubled for a price that is undisclosed. It has 13.3-inch 1080p IPS display with thin bezels on the main screen and a fingerprint sensor built inside power button. The laptop has featherweight portability just like other Thinkbook line laptops.

### Summary

As you know, the laptop with second screens are placed in different places near keyboard but this is the first time I've seen the screen placed on top of lid of laptop. The laptop is flat and whole lid is metal except the screen which is 10.8 inch matte glass e-Ink panel. The price quite high but you cannot assume the exact price of laptop with E Ink display on top of its lid as second screen.
