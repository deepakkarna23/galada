Microsoft has already ended supporting Windows 7  officially from 14<sup>th</sup> January which means there will be no more software updates, security patches or technical support. Though Microsoft's free upgrade offer was ended a few years ago for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users, you can still upgrade to Windows 10 for free. The company continues to activate Windows 10 license for people wanting to upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1.

Technically, you don't need to upgrade immediately. According to Microsoft you are still able to use Windows 7 for unlimited time. This is not good idea if you care for security because you won't get software update, security patches or fixes. Your PC is more vulnerable to exploits and attackers.

Microsoft targets to make Windows 10 an all-in-one operating system for its products.
