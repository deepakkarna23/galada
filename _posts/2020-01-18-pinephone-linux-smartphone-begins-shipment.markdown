PinePhone is an open source phone developed by <a href="https://ww.pine64.org">Pine64</a> which is most popular exciting hardware company right now for Linux users. Since PinePhone is an open source smartphone, it is supported by all major Linux phone projects. PinePhone smartphone is an affordable Linux phone created by the makers of <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/">Pinebook Pro laptop</a> and <a href="https://www.pine64.org/devices/single-board-computers/pine-a64/" target="_blank">Pine64 single board computer</a>.

The price and spec of <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/" target="_blank">PinePhone</a> is super low costing $149. The design is also kept low. PinePhone is cheapest alternative to Android and iOS devices built for Linux enthusiasts and developers who requires privacy minded open source software and its hardware kill switches. 

Previously, it was available to developers and hackers which got better responses and suggestions. So, Pine64 developers planned to bring it for everyone. After a long gap, the shipments to pre-ordered units of PinePhone Braveheart Edition started on Jan 17, 2020.

PinePhone runs an open source Linux-based operating system preloaded with Linux OS (postmarketOS) as factory test image running in it. The operating system preinstalled is testing version and Pine64 assumes or expects the user to at least install OS of their choice which is definitely not for soft hearted. Thus, PinePhone is named BraveHeart edition.

### PinePhone vs Purism Librem 5

<a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/" target="_blank">Purism Librem 5</a> is also Linux phone device that uses desktop class components which is not suitable for phone form factor and thus, is arguably more powerful than PinePhone. Librem is expensive and may also not support alternate OS as the PinePhone. Both device are privacy consciously built for open source enthusiasts and developers, who can tweak the system as per their requirement.

### Operating System Support
